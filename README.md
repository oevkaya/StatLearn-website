### Statistical Learning with R
TED University remote lecture series notes organized for 

Fall/Spring 2021-2022

<hr>

This course introduces the introductory level of Statistical Learning with R course notes that are designed for 2021. Lecture slides are created by using the main course book and related readings. Weekly slides and hands-on session materials are all created by R programming. 

Main objective of this course is to introduce fundamental statistical modeling
techniques to students and enable them to solve real life problems using
these various methods using R language as a statistical computation tool.

Applications include real data from wide-range of fields following reproducible practices. Homeworks will be assessed individually, but the project can be prepared as a small team (it depends on the total number of enrolments for the course).
