## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

There are three main structural elements to an R Markdown document:

### Header (YAML header)

The section at the beginning of the document within subsequent - - - signs is call the header. This is where you
will specify the title and author of the document. The output: statement indicates what type
of document you wish to generate when you click on knit button. The option pdf_document will
create a .pdf document, whilst html_document creates a .html page.


### R code Chunk

An R code chunk enables you to embed code into your document. If correctly created, the lines within the R chunk should be
highlighted in grey. You can include a unique label to each of the chunks by typing it within the
curly brackets at the beginning of the code chunk. Additional requirements can also be specified
here such as to not show the output or to not evaluate the code.
To test whether to code within a chunk works correctly, you can run the code by clicking on the
run chunk button . Any output will appear below the chunk within the markdown document.

```{r carseat, echo = TRUE}
library(ISLR2)
data("Carseats")

# Descriptive statistics for Carseats variables
summary(Carseats)

```


### Body 

The body of the markdown document is all of the remaining lines of the file. Here you can write
section heading (using #) and subheading (##) to structure your document, and write plain text
to give written based answers to questions or explain the meaning of the R output. Markdown
supports LATEXcoding, which allows you to write mathematical formulas within a pair of dollar
symbols, e.g.$y = \alpha + \beta x$ will be presented as y = α + βx.
Note: If there is a mistake in your code (either in the markdown, R chunk or LATEX), the output
is not created until you fix it. Details of the error can be found under the ‘R Markdown’ tab in the
bottom-left panel. The alternative would be to not to use the R Markdown file and just type and
save your solutions for the computer workshop in an R script as described earlier.

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

If you set `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk, it prevents printing of the R code that generated the plot.
